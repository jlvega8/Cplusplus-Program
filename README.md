# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was created for Corner Grocer that needed a program that analyzes text records throughout the day. The records are a list of items that were purchased in chronological order from the time the store opened. The store needs the program to show how many times an item was purchased so the store can have an effective layout for their customers. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I was able to include all the important information needed to make the program work and being able to get the results that was needed. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the python code because the python code is the more important code for the program to work and get the number of items purchased. By making it clear and simple for it can readable. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project was writing the C++ code because it was more of a complex code trying to make the first part of the program makingthe display at the beginning. I over came this challenge by remembering other assignments and projects having to do a similar code so using a similar format to making this projects code. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill that can be transferable to other projects and course work is being able to put two languages into one program. It can be helpful when the next time i have to put two different programs into one. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making it simple and having spaces to be able to see all the lines more clear for it can be readable.
